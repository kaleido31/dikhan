    <h1>HISTORY OF DERA ISMAIL KHAN</h1>
    <hr />
    <div>
      <p>Dera Ismail Khan, known as D.I. Khan, is a city in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan. It sits at the
      confluence of the Indus and Gomal Rivers on the west bank of the Indus. The name "Dera" means "camp" in the local
      language. The area around Dera Ismail Khan has been inhabited for thousands of years, with evidence from archaeological sites
      dating back to 3300 BCE. By the 7th century, the city was home to a diverse population that included Brahmins and
      Buddhists.</p>

      <p>In the 15th century, the region became part of Derajat, a territory established when Baloch people were invited to
    settle by Shah Husayn of the Langah Sultanate of Multan. Malik Sohrab Khan Dodai, originally from Makran in Balochistan,
    was appointed to govern the area around Dera Ismail Khan. His son, Ismail Khan, is traditionally credited with founding
    the city, although historical records from Emperor Babur's visit in 1506 do not mention it. During the Mughal Empire, Dera Ismail Khan was part of the Multan Subah and served as a key trading hub along the route
    connecting Multan to Kandahar. Despite its strategic location, it did not achieve great prominence until the British
    colonial period. In the early 19th century, the original town of Dera Ismail Khan was devastated by flooding from the Indus River. Nawab
    Sher Muhammad Khan of the Saddozai clan rebuilt the city in 1825, relocating it to a safer area on a small plateau away
    from the river's main channel. The reconstruction was planned with input from architects brought from Punjab, who
    designed the city layout with separate areas for Hindu and Muslim communities.</p>

      <p>Under British rule, Dera Ismail Khan became an important administrative center. In 1861, it was designated as the
    capital of the newly formed Dera Ismail Khan Division. The city developed rapidly, with the establishment of a
    cantonment area, civil hospital, and educational institutions supported by British colonial authorities. The population grew steadily, with Muslims becoming the majority after the partition of India in 1947, which led to the
    migration of Hindus and Sikhs to India and Muslim refugees from India settling in Dera Ismail Khan.</p>
    
    <p>In more recent times, Dera Ismail Khan has faced challenges including terrorist attacks and instability, particularly
    during the period from 2007 to 2014 when the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan conducted a series of bombings and attacks in
    the region. The city was also a target of the wider Operation Zarb-e-Azb launched by Pakistan's military against
    militant groups across the country. Despite these challenges, Dera Ismail Khan continues to be an important city in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, contributing to
    regional trade and development. The announcement of the Haklaâ€“Dera Ismail Khan Motorway as part of the China-Pakistan
    Economic Corridor underscores its potential for further growth and connectivity in the region.</p>
